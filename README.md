This repository contains the source project files for my Final Project for [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning). You may view the presentation [here](http://www.jcano.me/learning-how-to-learn).

It is intended to be a web presentation, explaining and teaching three (3) topics that I've found most interesting during the session. These topics are subject material that I have already applied to my life, both as a working professional and a lifelong learner. I have learned a lot by taking this course, and I hope that by taking the time to view my presentation, it will enourage you to take the class as well!

##Topics Covered
1. Focused and Diffused modes of Thinking
2. Procrastination
3. Chunking

###Etc.
This presentation is powered by [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).

As this project is a software project, I will be making updates and changes as I see fit. My goal
is to make this presentation as enjoyable as it can be.
